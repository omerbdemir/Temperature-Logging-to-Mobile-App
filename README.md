# Temperature-Logging-to-Mobile-App
In this project ı used :
-Raspberry Pi model B
-Android Studio
-DHT11 Temperature and humidity sensor
-MySQL server from www.freemysqlhosting.net

The python script reads temperature and humidity and sends the data to 
MySQL database. The app ı created with android studio gathers that data
from the database and presents them in a list.
